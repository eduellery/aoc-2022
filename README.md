My answers for Advent of Code 2022.[^disclaimer]

[^disclaimer]: **Disclaimer**: I do AoC for fun and to learn new languages and new tricks. Part of my learning process (also for fun, even if I
already have experience with some language), is to check what other users do and learn things from them. I can't help but incorporate
their cool, clean, concise ideas into my code. Sometimes their code is *so* much better than mine that I end up replacing my whole code!
So I *do* come up with answers on my own, but I can't claim being the author of anything here - I'm not tracking what is mine and what I replaced. ðŸ¤·
